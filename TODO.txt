Launch script todo

DONE   1. save config file to directory
DONE   2. add test of best evolved walker and record values to file (along with modulation signal!)
DONE   3. generate plots upon completion
DONE   4. email plots upon completion


Plotting todo

DONE    1. CRAWL PASSED IN DIRECTORY rather than iterate through
DONE    2. Make plot of all the individual runs in one plot
DONE    3. Make aggregate plot with shaded regions are error space (1 STD)
DONE	4. Make comparison plots of list of different experiments
DONE    5. Make plot of the agent speed over time, overlayed with neuron activations and modulation signal
DONE	6. Make a plot of the cyclic trajectory of 3 output neurons in 3d space

Analysis Todo

		1. create datasets of the neuron's output without the effects of modulation
DONE	2. generate testing mode of primary executable for different modulation conditions
???		3. generate 2/3d plots of 4,5 neurons with PCA
